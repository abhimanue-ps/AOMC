               3. Existing System & Need for the Proposed System
3.1 Overview of the Existing System
In the current scenario, mathematical calculations, particularly advanced and complex ones, are primarily performed using either manual methods, scientific calculators, or general-purpose software tools such as Microsoft Excel, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, or online calculators. These systems vary significantly in terms of usability, accessibility, and functionality.
Manual Calculation Methods:
In educational environments, students are often taught to solve mathematical problems manually. While this enhances conceptual clarity, manual calculations are time-consuming, prone to human error, and impractical for large data sets or highly complex equations such as advanced calculus, differential equations, and matrix operations.
Scientific Calculators:
Scientific calculators have long been the traditional tools for students and professionals for performing complex calculations. While useful, they are restricted in terms of memory, input capability, and advanced visualization (like graph plotting or step-by-step solutions). Scientific calculators are also standalone devices that do not offer integration with modern computing environments such as the web, where students and researchers might prefer to work collaboratively.
General-purpose Software and Online Tools:
Many students, researchers, and professionals turn to software like MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, GeoGebra, and Python-based computational libraries such as NumPy and SymPy. These tools are powerful but come with inherent limitations:
    • Cost Factor: Professional software like MATLAB and Mathematica are expensive, restricting access for students from economically weaker sections.
    • Steep Learning Curve: Tools like MATLAB require considerable programming knowledge, which may not be suitable for students from non-computer science backgrounds.
    • Internet Dependency: Many advanced tools require continuous internet access, especially cloud-based calculators, which poses challenges in rural areas with poor connectivity.
    • Data Privacy Concerns: With online calculators, users enter potentially sensitive or research-related data directly into cloud systems, raising privacy concerns.

3.2 Key Limitations of the Existing System
    • Fragmentation: There is no single, unified tool that covers all branches of advanced mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics, probability, etc.) in an offline, easy-to-use format.
    • Device Dependency: Scientific calculators are hardware devices; online tools are browser-dependent. Users do not have a consistent, centralized system.
    • Limited Flexibility: Scientific calculators are rigid in their operations. They lack the flexibility to customize formula libraries or add user-defined functions easily.
    • Poor Integration with Academic Workflows: Academic and research users often want to store, export, or reference their calculations for thesis or project work, which is poorly supported by existing tools.
    • No Offline Advanced Mathematical Calculation System: A fully offline, open-source, customizable, and extendable advanced mathematical calculator is almost absent in the market.

3.3 Real-World Challenges Observed
The need for an improved system became particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when students had to study from home. Many of them, especially from rural areas, struggled to access reliable online calculators due to poor internet connectivity. Scientific calculators were either unaffordable or lacked support for advanced topics covered in higher education syllabi.
Furthermore, undergraduate and postgraduate students often need to perform subject-specific calculations, such as those related to Fourier transforms, Laplace transforms, numerical methods, probability distributions, and matrix manipulations, which many basic calculators cannot handle effectively.

3.4 Proposed System: Advanced Offline Mathematical Calculator (AOMC)
